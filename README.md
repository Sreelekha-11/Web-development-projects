# Project 1:  Form Validation (HTML, CSS, JS)

A frontend mini project that validates user input in a form using client-side logic.
It ensures correct data entry by displaying error messages and preventing invalid submissions.

## Algorithm
1. Display the form with required input fields.
2. When the user clicks the submit button, capture all input values.
3. Check whether each required field is empty.
4. Validate the email format using predefined rules.
5. Validate the password based on minimum length and conditions.
6. If any input is invalid, display an appropriate error message.
7. Prevent form submission until all inputs are valid.

# Project 2:  Search & Filter  (HTML, CSS, JS)
This project demonstrates a basic search and filter functionality using JavaScript.
It dynamically updates the displayed items based on user input.

## Algorithm
1. Read the text entered in the search box.  
2. Compare the text with each list item.  
3. Show matching items and hide others.  
4. Display “No results found” if no match exists.  
5. Show all items when the search box is empty.

# Project 3: Todo App (HTML, CSS, JS)
It is a simple Todo application built using JavaScript to practice DOM manipulation and event handling.

## Algorithm
1. Get references to the input field, add button, and task list from the DOM.
2. Listen for a click event on the **Add** button.
3. When the button is clicked:
   - Read the value entered in the input field.
   - If the input is empty, stop the process.
4. Create a new list item (`li`) and add the task text to it.
5. Add a click event to the task to toggle its completed state.
6. Create a delete button for the task.
7. Add a click event to the delete button to remove the task from the list.
8. Append the task item to the task list.
9. Clear the input field after adding the task.
